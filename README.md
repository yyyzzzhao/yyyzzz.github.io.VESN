> ## Abstract
> We proposed a virtual elastography synthesis network (VESN) to synthesis virtual strain elastography (SE) images by taking routinely used B-mode US images as inputs.
> The deep learning model proposed in the work empowers portable US device with biomechanical imaging capabilities and may promotes the wider application of portable US devices in breast cancer screening  
> *Overview of the VESN model is shown below*
